# --- Project Specific Data ---
# We ignore all outputs but keep the folder structure via .gitkeep
data/outputs/*
!data/outputs/.gitkeep

# --- Tracking the Brain ---
# We explicitly do NOT ignore knowledge_base.json so it can be version controlled
# data/knowledge_base.json is NOT in this list, meaning git will track it.
